According to various alliance member the Cleopatra event is a **scam**!

Do not spend gems when using the keys, the rewards are not worth it.

Rather => "disassemble" the key parts in your items screen to get resource chests!

On the other hand the Tych wheel is generous:

_"The Tych wheel is awesome! Do it 20x and get 1200 hours of training speed ups!
(Click the small chest to the left of the meter)"_ -- KevinC2030
