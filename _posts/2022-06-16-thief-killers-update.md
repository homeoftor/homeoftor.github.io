_updated June 16th, 2022: remove DarkLord and Kaz_

The following is a list of members that are capable of killing Royal Thieves. When the carriage shows up
at your walls, you select five alliance members to help you kill them.

Please, after you select them, give the invited members a call out in the Alliance Chat and post the
coordinates of your thieves so they don't have to go looking for them.

1. Queen Spicy
2. Jubub
3. SuperJova
4. Fern
5. P3A (pea)
