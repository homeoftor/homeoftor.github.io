Good morning TOR family!

The undead invasion event will start Saturday 17:00 server time (
[What time is 1700Z in my timezone? click here to see!](http://time.unitarium.com/utc/1700)).
A few tips to remember:

1. send all your siege machines out to gather or hide them in your bunker. Else you will have
to pay many gems to heal them.

2. not a bad idea to put up a bubble or shield you won't notice if another person is attacking
your city since the zombies will turn your screen red.

3. PUT HEALING CROWN ON MONARCH! Also try and heal all your troops between waves and hit the
help button to request help. Send help to your alliance mates by hitting the help all button
as well. It is most important to have all of your troops healed between the waves.

4. it is advised to use some city buffs such as attack up, defense up, and increased HP.

5. this would be a good time to start small research projects or a large construction project
to take advantage of the large amount of members hitting the help button

6. if you have lost 2 waves and you're done, consider sending troops to an alliance mate's
city to reinforce them. This will still get you points for the event. **Jubub** is in charge
of directing reinforcements, ask for his instructions.

7. keep alliance chat to a mininum - only post a defense report if you killed less than 100%
of the undead wave and are looking to receive reinforcements

Good luck and have fun!
