Hello TOR family!

We are going to start focusing on lower level alliance science to increase buffs for
everyone. I will try to keep one "recommended" meaning it will have a red border and
be at the top of the list.

You are free to donate to others but please try to do the recommended one a few times
a day.

Remember you can max out the donations every 4 hours for minimal resources. The credits
you get can be used in the Alliance Shop.

Thank you for your attention to this.
