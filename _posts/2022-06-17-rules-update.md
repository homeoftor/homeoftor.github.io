_revised on June 17th, 2022: insert rule#4 about R4's authority_

Welcome to TOR!
Please read and follow these rules.
Do not hesitate to ask for any clarification!

1. Respect your Queen

2. Respect her R4s as well. They are chosen by her to help and are an extension of her leadership.

3. No Fenrir attacks whithin the hive or immediate vicinity. The reason for this being that when you kill a fenrir,
reward chests will appear and if you are too close to the hive, they will land inside the hive and may take someone's
assigned spot. A safe distance of approximately 50km from the hive has been established. Please teleport to that
distance and then summon all you want. This will make sure no chest appear in the hive but still be close enough for
members to run to claim the reward chests.

4. Donate at least one march of resources, each day, to the alliance warehouse. This helps our alliance grow.

5. Donate to alliance science as well. You can do it with minimal resources every 4 hours. Please do it as often
as you can. We all share the buffs it gives.

6. For monster rallies send 1 general and 1 troop only. (Recommend Cavalry)

7. Check alliance chat (AC), email and website regularly for updates.

8. Have fun and enjoy yourself

9. Always refer back to rule #1.

Thank you for your attention to those rules.

Happy to have you as part of the TOR family!
