Good morning TOR family!

The undead invasion event starts every Saturday at 17:00 server time (
[What time is 1700Z in my timezone? click here to see!](http://time.unitarium.com/utc/1700)).


### Checklist (Short)

Those are simple and effective checklists to make sure you are not forgetting anything.
Ask on Alliance Chat if you are not sure what they mean.

#### 10 minutes before the Event

* Healing Crown set on Monarch
* Adjust Monarch gear for best attack/defense/HP on your strongest type
* Ressources stocks filled-up, ready for Healing
* Strong Defense General on Wall Duty
* Range General in Archer Tower
* All siege machines in Bunker or out Gathering for more than 80 minutes
* Bubble UP

#### After the first wave

* Activate 1-hour Attack, Defense and HP buffs

#### During the Event

* Keep pushing the "Help All" button on top of embassy, every time it appears
* Run small research / upgrade projects that will be boosted by the Help
* Once your kill rate on a wave is strictly less than 100%, share your defense
report on AC chat to get reinforcements

### Special trick for wave 5, 10, and 20

Waves 5, 10 and 20 are made only of ground troops! you can optimize by:
* Set Monarch Gear to full Cavalry attack/defense/HP (best troops against ground)
* Reset to normal defense after the wave

#### After you have lost 2 times and you are out

* Post a single message to **Jubub** on the AC to propose reinforcements,
and wait for instructions
* Keep pushing the "Help All" button on top of embassy, every time it appears,
**until the end of the event**

#### After the last wave

* You can post on the AC how many waves you killed and your final score



### Instructions (Long)

A few tips to remember:

1. send all your siege machines out to gather or hide them in your bunker. Else you will have
to pay many gems to heal them.

2. not a bad idea to put up a bubble or shield you won't notice if another person is attacking
your city since the zombies will turn your screen red.

3. PUT HEALING CROWN ON MONARCH! Also try and heal all your troops between waves and hit the
help button to request help. Send help to your alliance mates by hitting the help all button
as well. It is most important to have all of your troops healed between the waves.

4. it is advised to use some city buffs such as attack up, defense up, and increased HP.

5. this would be a good time to start small research projects or a large construction project
to take advantage of the large amount of members hitting the help button

6. if you have lost 2 waves and you're done, consider sending troops to an alliance mate's
city to reinforce them. This will still get you points for the event. **Jubub** is in charge
of directing reinforcements, ask for his instructions.

7. keep alliance chat to a mininum - only post a defense report if you killed less than 100%
of the undead wave and are looking to receive reinforcements

Good luck and have fun!
