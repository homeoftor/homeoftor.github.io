SvS is 48 hours war between two servers (us, and the enemy!), played every two weeks.

essential parts of SvS:
- accumulating small points: fairies, statues, monsters
- gaining large points: PvP!
- not actually so important: temples

SvS is very important because:
1. you get to fight as a united server against a whole server, think KE on steroids!
2. there are very handsome rewards (gems!) for those who participate


# The Purge

2 hours before SvS starts (warning! it starts at midnight server time, not at server reset like other
events), the leaders of the server will run a _purge_. The idea of the Purge is to collect all the
easy points before the enemy does: unbubbled players, dead accounts, and armies sitting on relics and
ressources.

Don't get caught in the purge: recall all your troops and put a bubble on, at least before the purge starts.

Even better, participate: add "PURGE" to your player name, and when the purge starts, go and zero all
those easy targets.

But be careful:
- never attack a player with PURGE in his name, he is also purging
- once SvS starts, the purge is over, and you should focus on the enemy


# I don't want to or can not play! What should I do?

The key is not to "give" points to the enemy server:
1. put on a 3 days bubble (2,500 gems) before the event starts
2. do not go on relics (during SvS you can and will be attacked on relic tiles)
3. do not go on ressources (during SvS you can and will be attacked on ressource tiles)

And of course do not disrupt your own server in any way (i.e. do not attack anyone on your own server)


# I want to help my server! What can I do?

You don't need to be a big player to make some serious damage, below is a list of tactics that you can do depending on your power.

Remember Foolio's words: "you are not weak, you are small - small and weak are not the same".


## Bring in the small points (everyone)

Small points accumulate! If you have time and energy, there is a lot you can bring in by:
- locating and visiting Fire Spirits (aka fairies) => share their location within your alliance!
- locating and visiting Ares Statues => share their location within your alliance!
- killing normal monsters and boss monsters

Doing the same on the enemy server brings more points but is riskier, but can still be relatively safe if:
- you use the world map to find a "safe" location before teleporting on the enemy server (away from enemy hives,
sparsely populated with enemy cities or mostly abandoned, a good concentration of monsters and fairies)
- you reduce your potential damage by bunkering/ghosting your troops and removing your defense generals
- you bookmark targets before teleporting and use the free 5 minutes bubble (that you can not extend) to
kill as many targets as you can, and teleport back once the bubble drops

IMPORTANT: always bookmark the spot you want to teleport back to so you can very quickly teleport back
when in need


## Share intelligence (everyone)

Keep browsing the maps of the servers (yours and the enemy) to find and share locations of:
- unbubbled enemy cities (potential targets for large PvP players)
- fairies and statues

Note: use the Browse Map button in the map screen to browse the other server (or use a bookmark)


## Play Bait (recommended for small players - < 10M power)

The whole idea is to push some enemy players to unbubble (or even better, send armies) at you so that a
team of stronger players can smash them down.

1. first, you need *coordination*: find one or more stronger players (the _smashers_) who will be attacking
the enemies that take your bait - make sure you are synchronized and chatting
2. then, you need to be small and minimize the damage you will get by being attacked (remove your defense generals, keep only 20-ish troops put all others in bunker)
3. locate a possible target on the enemy server (large player, enemy alliance hive) and teleport close to them
4. if they are not taking the bait, start sending out 1-man marches (without generals!) to their cities
5. as soon as an enemy drops its bubble and sends a march at you, have the _smashers_ jump in and destroy him

Alternatives for the last step:
- the reinforced bait: have a large player of your alliance reinforce you with powerful troops while baiting
enemy smaller members, they will not see your reinforcements (requires Watchtower lvl 27+) and think you are
weak - big surprise!
- the port swap: when a large march is finally coming at you, teleport away and have a powerful player teleport
where you just were - the enemy attack will hit the powerful defenses and be smashed! (requires good timing!)
- the targeted ghost: ghost your large troops on certain players (they will change their marches and can be attacked)


## Play Smash (medium to large players)

Find a small player to play bait, and use the techniques described above to take hits at enemy cities.


## Decoys and annoyance (small to medium players)

As a small player with your troops protected, or a player with your troops ghosted (so you are not a valuable
target) you can annoy the hell out of large intruders by Scouting and running 1-man marches (very easy to heal)
at them continuously. This will push them to a fault (like sending a large march at you, diminishing their
defense) or at least prevent them from seeing the real attacks in the cloud of alerts created by your decoys.

This is a very effective tactic for very large intruders attacking your own server, confuse and annoy them while
a group of strong players is preparing a combined march to take them down. It also works well on enemy players
occupying your Temples or City of Throne buildings.


## Don't get trapped

Resist the urge to drop your bubble to attack a very yummy target looking defenseless, it could be a bait, and
you could be loosing a lot of points (see the above techniques).

Ask a K27+ to check if the target has been reinforced or not?

Take some time to observe the player, is he teleporting around? is he sending very small marches? that could be
signs of a bait / trap.

Even then, it could be someone ghosting his troops and waiting for you to come in. Check the Monarch level and power
in the details to make sure you are not attacking more than you chew!


## PvP techniques (for medium to large players)

1. Scouting => never go to battle without intelligence (be careful, below K27 you do not see the reinforcements!)
2. Ghosting (as a bait or in defense)


### Ghosting

A technique to hide / protect troops from enemies (to surprise them, or to avoid loosing points when attacked).

You ghost your troops by triggering a 45 or 60 minutes alliance war at a target. While they are in the rallying
state, your troops are not visible to scouts, and not threatened by attacks. You can also "call them back" very
quickly by cancelling the rally (good to surprise a weak enemy march or to send your own march at an unsuspecting
enemy).

What target should you use to ghost your troops? (by order of preference):
 - use an untagged monarch (no stamina, no battle log alarm)
 - or, use someone from your server but another alliance (no stamina, no battle log alert for the enemy)
 - or, use a monster (some stamina, no battle log alert)

Improvements:
- keep a preferred "ghosting target" at the top of your bookmarks so you can ghost very quickly!
- after a successful attack on an enemy, immediately ghost your returning troops so that the enemy counter-attack is damageless
- ghost your marches separately by troop type so you can recall a specific troop type depending on the enemy's
attack (ex: he attacks with cavalry, call back your archers)
